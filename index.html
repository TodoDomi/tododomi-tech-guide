<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<h3 id="customer">Customer</h3>
<p>This is the app for the final consumer, the biggest and most complex one.<br>

<p>The shopper is one of the apps for tododomi workers. Shoppers are the first to handle user orders. They are suposed to be in shops and buy items for each user purchase.  The core flow of the shopper app is to accept an order, buy the items and mark a purchase as finished adn ready to be picked up.</p>

<li>Open google maps with marked destinations</li>
<li>Mark orders as not delivered</li>
<li>Call the user</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="react-redux">React-Redux</h2>
<p>The four applications use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>react-native</code> and <code>redux</code> as the state management solution.</li>
<li><code>react-native-navigation</code> as the navigation library.</li>
<li><code>redux-thunks</code> to handle async tasks on redux actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the apps use <code>immutable</code> as a way of ensuring immutability on redux reducers, with the exception of the restaurant app that uses <code>redux-starter-kit</code> which includes <code>immer</code> as the immutability library.</p>
<p>All the backend endpoints that the app uses are delared under <code>src/api</code>.<br>
This services are then used in thunks under <code>src/actions</code></p>
<p>The 3 apps using <code>immutable</code> make extensive use of selectors (<code>src/selectors</code>) in order to avoid recopmutation of the expensive <code>toJS</code> method of <code>immutable</code> objects.</p>
<p><code>react-native-navigation</code> screens are declared in <code>src/screens</code><br>
There is a container (<code>src/containers</code>) for each of these screens.</p>
<p>Sessions are managed by <code>redux-react-native-session</code> and persisted to local-storage. The authentication method is token based and is addapted to the default method in the ruby gem <code>devise-token-auth</code></p>
